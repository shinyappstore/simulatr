# Simulation of Linear Model Data

This shiny application is an interface to the R-package called `simrel`. This package simulates the linear model data with wide range of properties based on users parameters. The parameters depends on the number of response variables. Based on number of response, the package has three main functions: Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate.
