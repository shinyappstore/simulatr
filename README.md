# simulatr: Simulation of Linear Model Data

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/simulatr](https://shinyappstore.com/a/simulatr)__

This shiny application is an interface to the R-package called simrel. This package simulates the linear model data with wide range of properties based on users parameters. The parameters depends on the number of response variables. Based on number of response, the package has three main functions: Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate. Sæbø, Almøy, and Helland (2015) started this r-package based on the concept of relevant components (Helland and Almøy 1994) in order to simulate the linear model data with single response by controlling few simulation parameters. These parameters includes number of relevant predictors, decay factor of eigenvalues and coefficients of determination. In addition, user can even specify the position of the relevant principle components. Since the package is based on covariance structure of latent space (principle components), by tuining few simulation parameters this package is able to give datasets wide range of properties.
